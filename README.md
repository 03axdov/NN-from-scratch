# Neural-Network-Framework
A Neural Network framework, built with Python and Numpy.

While the framework is currently functional it is not done. Stochastic Gradient Descent is currently the only optimizer, training can not be done on GPU's and there are only a few activation functions to choose from.

If you want to run the repository, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and write your code in main.py. An example of a model built for the fizzbuzz problem is currently given.

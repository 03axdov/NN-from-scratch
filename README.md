# Neural-Network-Framework
A Neural Network framework, built with Python and Numpy.

While the framework is currently functional it is not done. There are several improvements that can be addressed:
- More optimizers, activation functions etc.
- More layers, such as Conv2D and other convolutional layers
- Training on GPU's
- Saving model parameters and initializing these later on
- Additional functionality for working with databases

If you want to run the repository, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and write your code in main.py. An example of a model built for the fizzbuzz problem is currently given.
